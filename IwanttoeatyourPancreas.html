			<span id="plot"> 
				The film starts with an unnamed boy being bothered by a girl in their high school library. She is fascinated by a supposed Japanese custom of eating a body part from a loved one to cure a disease afflicting the same body part. <br> <br>
				Our nameless protagonist is an oddball loner, withdrawn and unpopular by choice, according to him. He spends his time working at the school library because he believes books are better than people. It doesn’t take long to notice that he isn’t as stoic as he thinks he is, and he’s just a guy fighting against himself and against his own self-professed beliefs. One day, he happens to find a diary in a hospital. The diary belongs to his classmate Sakura, the girl from the library. <br> <br>
				Sakura is an exuberant, cheerful and popular girl from his school; the only problem is that she has a terminal pancreatic illness and only a few months left to live. Once our silent main guy discovers this fact, Sakura explains that he is the only person other than her family who knows about her condition, as she wants to maintain a regular school life for as long as she can. So, the boy promises to keep her secret. The film then deals with Sakura as she decides to spend her last few months latched onto our loner protagonist, whose point of view carries the story forward. <br> <br>
				The biggest surprise in I Want To Eat Your Pancreas is how funny it is. Sakura is well aware of her impending death, so she copes with it with deadpan gallows humor that may make some audience members uncomfortable. There’s also the not-so-typical relationship between Sakura and our protagonist (I swear they say his name before the film ends, but it’s a thing that he won’t say it at first). Their initial misjudgments are quite funny, as Sakura keeps forcing her nameless friend to help her check crazier and crazier things off her bucket list, but their banter and dynamic becomes quite sweet to see and the dialogue feels natural. When Sakura can’t understand why her new friend won’t talk to anyone at school, the resulting tension between them also rings true to our own struggles in relating to and engaging with people. <br> <br>
				The very young Studio VOLN handles the film’s animation, which is pretty to look at but never distracts from the plot. Pastel colors dominate I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, especially the color pink which dominates Sakura’s world and parallels the cherry blossoms that follow wherever the camera goes, a key part of the film’s themes. Sakura’s journey takes her through sunshine-soaked outdoor scenes and brightly lit interiors as her backlit figure contemplates the eternal light of the world she will soon stop being a part of. This is all contrasted with the dark and rainy streets our protagonist is often walking down, the wet ground reflecting headlights from night-time traffic. There are even a couple of scenes where the animation enhances the film, particularly a night-time scene with fireworks that will both make your jaw drop and your tear ducts work overtime. <br> <br>
				There’s also the theme of “chance versus fate” that runs through I Want to Eat Your Pancreas, the idea that fate is nothing but the result of thousands of choices we make though life. It’s a sentiment that makes you look at certain characters in a different light, and one that makes the “girl wants a boy to enjoy life” part of the story more profound than you’d think coming from a film with a title like this one.
