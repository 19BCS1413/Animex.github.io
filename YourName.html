			<span id="plot"> 
				Mitsuha Miyamizu is a high school girl living in the town of Itomori near Hida region. She is bored with small town life and wishes to be a handsome Tokyo boy in her next life. She begins to switch bodies intermittently with Taki Tachibana, a high school boy in Tokyo, when they wake up. They communicate by writing messages on paper, phones and sometimes on each other's skin. Mitsuha causes Taki to develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki causes Mitsuha to become popular in school. <br> <br>
				One day, Taki, as Mitsuha, accompanies her grandmother and sister to leave the ritual alcohol kuchikamizake, made by Mitsuha, as an offering at the family shrine on a mountaintop outside the town. The shrine is believed to represent the body of the village guardian god ruling human experiences and connections. Mitsuha's latest note tells Taki about the comet Tiamat expected to pass Earth on the day of her town festival. <br> <br>
				The next day, Taki wakes up in his body. After an unsuccessful date with Miki, he tries to call Mitsuha, but cannot reach her and the body-switching ends. He decides to meet her directly, but not knowing the town's name he has to rely on his memories of the scenery. A restaurant owner in Hida recognizes Itomori from Taki's sketch and tells him when the comet unexpectedly split into two; the larger piece kept moving, but the smaller one crashed onto Earth and destroyed the town. Looking at the site of the crater and while in disbelief that Mitsuha died this whole time, her messages on his phone disappear and his memories start fading away. Taki finds Mitsuha's name in the records of fatalities and discovers from the date of the disaster that their timelines were separated by three years. <br> <br>
				Taki goes to the shrine to drink Mitsuha's sake from the bottle, hoping to reconnect with her body and warn her about the comet strike. Through a vision, Taki discovers that a girl he met on the train was Mitsuha, not knowing they were separated for three years. She had instead met his past self while trying to meet with him personally. He wakes up in her body on the morning of the town festival. Mitsuha's grandmother deduces what happened, and tells him the body-switching is part of the family history and caretakers for the shrine. Taki convinces Teshi and Sayaka, two of Mitsuha's friends, to help everyone evacuate the town, by disabling the electrical substation and broadcasting a false emergency alert, while Taki assumes Mitsuha's role as the mayor's daughter to try and persuade him to evacuate the town. Realizing that Mitsuha is in his body at the shrine, Taki goes back to find her. <br> <br>
				Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body at the shrine. When Taki reaches there as the sun is setting, the two sense each other's presence, but are separated by three years, but when twilight falls (referred to in the film as "magic hour" or "kataware-doki"),[note 1] they return to their own bodies and meet. They attempt to write their names on each hands so they will remember each other, but twilight passes and Mitsuha disappears before she can write hers. The evacuation plan fails, and Mitsuha is determined to convince her father evacuate the town. Going to do so, Mitsuha notices her memories for Taki starting to fade, and discovers he wrote "I love you" on her hand instead of his name. Despite the evacuation, the comet piece crashes to Earth and destroys the town. Taki wakes up in his own time, only to remember nothing. <br> <br>
				Five years after his visit to Itomori, Taki has graduated from university and searches for a job. He senses he lost something important, but feels drawn to the disaster, learning that the inhabitants of the town survived by following the mayor's order. One day, Taki and Mitsuha see each other when their trains draw parallel, and are compelled to disembark and search for one another, finally meeting on the stairs of Suga Shrine. They initially walk past each other as they are both shocked, but Taki turns around and inquires if they had known each other before. Mitsuha replies that she had the same feeling, and with their connection re-established, they shed tears of happiness and simultaneously ask for their names.
