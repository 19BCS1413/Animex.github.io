Soon, Xiao Yu told Li Mo that her family is making her apply to an elite university far away and that they would have to move away, angering Li Mo. Li Mo later decided to apply to the same university, though the academic gap between Li Mo and Xiao Yu was large. Li Mo, through hard work and a studious behavior, got accepted into the university, and when he went to Xiao Yu's apartment to tell the news, he learned that Xiao Yu is in the hospital after her father beat her for failing the application test.

Years later, Li Mo, now taking care of his own motel in a renovated shikumen, sees Xiao Yu in the front door and smiles. <br> <br>
